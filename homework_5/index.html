            I study accessibility, wearable technology, and build assistive technologies. As an accessibility and human-computer interaction researcher, I explore how technology can be used to understand human ability and support empowerment, independence, and improved quality of life. My research has focused on understanding user needs and designing technology systems that enhance and leverage the full potential of users with diverse abilities. While I spend a majority of my time on assistive technologies, I am also interested in web development, user experience, and physical computing.

            I'm a fifth year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University - Human Computer Interaction Institute,
            where I'm advised by Anind Dey and Mayank Goel. I work at the intersection of Human-computer Interaction,
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Health. I create systems and methods with the goal of understanding 
            human behavior and improving people's wellbeing. Towards this goal, I have worked in projects on Stress, 
            Activity Recognition and interruptibility detection. I'm currently focused on the personalization 
            of health interventions using a combination of AI, wearables and a smartphone.I have also worked 
            on novel input interaction techniques like keyboard surface interaction and gestures detection 
            using a smartwatch.

			I’m a third-year Phd student in human-computer interaction, advised by Jason Hong and Laura Dabbish. 
			I spent 20+ years as a journalist with a lot of job titles, including editor, designer, UX research + systems analyst: “Doer of Things No One Else Wants to Do”. I earned an M.S. in HCI from Indiana University (2017).
			My research lies in the human factors of cybersecurity. I seek to understand people’s behaviors and then use games, UX design and other interventions to help them keep themselves and their loved ones secure.
